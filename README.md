# Applied AI Hackathon PicoModel

### Motivation

Many open source models are too big to run on mobile devices. Mobile devices can safely run LLMs of up to 10B parameter size, but the smallest gpt-oss model is 20B parameters in size. We set out to shrink gpt-oss model size and compare its performance to current top <10B parameter models.
